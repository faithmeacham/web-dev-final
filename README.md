# Athena Advice
Bryn Mawr has a tradition of students leaving the statue of Athena in our Great Hall gifts in order to get good luck and advice. Our website plays off of this tradition and allows the user to select an offering to leave “Athena.” She, then, responds with a piece of wisdom or fortune.

The main.py file uses a bigram based model and the fortunes.txt corpus to generate the sentences of wisdom for Athena to give.
main.py links to the index.html in the templates directory using FastAPI and templates. All of the style files and images are in the static directory.
